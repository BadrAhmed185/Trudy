In RSA encryption, the padding scheme is used to add randomness and structure
to the message before encryption, making it more secure

Why use padding:
Ensures secure encryption even if the same message is encrypted multiple times.

Prevents attackers from guessing encrypted values or replaying them.

If you encrypt with PKCS1, you must decrypt using the same PKCS1 padding.
